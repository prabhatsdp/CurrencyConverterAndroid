# **Currency Converter Android App by Prabhat Pandey :man_technologist:**

## **[IMPORTANT] The app is currently not working.
The app is currently not working due to the api limitations implemented recently by ExchangeRateApi.io. It introduced
limit and changed the endpoints of the api. We are working on fixing the issue. Thank you.
